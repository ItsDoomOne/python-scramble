# python-scramble-ng

Python-scramble-ng is a fork of python-scramble by twstewart42, which is abandoned. This fork aims to fix it to work with the latest versions of the python language while also adding a few preferences of my own, like using command-line arguments instead of inputs, fixing some bugs and unhandled exceptions


# TO-DO
1. Fully implement the command-line system replacing the old input-based system.
2. Implement guard clauses to replace the nested if statements
3. Implement the descrambling logic
4. Implement more scrambling algorithms that I've created years ago (Like line-line scrambling and center scrambling)
